Mod 4 analysis of (fake) school data

## Overview of School District Analysis
The current school district requires an analysis of Math and Reading assessment scores for the fifteen (15) schools located in this area, including both district schools and charter schools. The distinction between district and charter schools will be ignored for the entirety of this analysis, with the exception of performance by school type. Several key metrics are presented here, providing actionable information for school district administrators. These key metrics include:  

* Top 5 Schools in % Overall Passing (Math & Reading)  
* Bottom 5 Schools in % Overall Passing  
* Average Math scores for each grade by school 
* Average Reading scores for each grade by school  
* School performance based on school budget per student
* School performance based on school size
* School performance based on school type

## Results of Statistical Analysis
A complete statistical analysis was completed for every school in the area of the school district. Upon completion of the analysis, potential academic dishonesty was discovered in the math and reading grades at Thomas High School in ninth grade. As such, an important component of this analysis will include the comparison of the original dataset against the newly completed analysis that has removed the data from all ninth grade students at Thomas HS. The following questions guided this analysis: 

* How is the district summary affected?
* How is the school summary affected?
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
	* Math and reading scores by grade
	* Scores by school spending
	* Scores by school size
	* Scores by school type


### District Summary
